/**
 * TestWorkflowEnvironment provides workflow unit testing capabilities.
 *
 * <p>Testing the workflow code is hard as it might be potentially very long running. The included
 * in-memory implementation of the Cadence service supports <b>an automatic time skipping</b>.
 * Anytime a workflow under the test as well as the unit test code are waiting on a timer (or sleep)
 * the internal service time is automatically advanced to the nearest time that unblocks one of the
 * waiting threads. This way a workflow that runs in production for months is unit tested in
 * milliseconds. Here is an example of a test that executes in a few milliseconds instead of over
 * two hours that are needed for the workflow to complete:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *   public class SignaledWorkflowImpl implements SignaledWorkflow {
 *     private String signalInput;
 *
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     public String workflow1(String input) {
 *       Workflow.sleep(Duration.ofHours(1));
 *       Workflow.await(() -> signalInput != null);
 *       Workflow.sleep(Duration.ofHours(1));
 *       return signalInput + "-" + input;
 *     }
 *
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     public void processSignal(String input) {
 *       signalInput = input;
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 * {@literal @}Test
 *  public void testSignal() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
 *    TestWorkflowEnvironment testEnvironment = TestWorkflowEnvironment.newInstance();
 *
 *    // Creates a worker that polls tasks from the service owned by the testEnvironment.
 *    Worker worker = testEnvironment.newWorker(TASK_LIST);
 *    worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes(SignaledWorkflowImpl.class);
 *    worker.start();
 *
 *    // Creates a WorkflowClient that interacts with the server owned by the testEnvironment.
 *    WorkflowClient client = testEnvironment.newWorkflowClient();
 *    SignaledWorkflow workflow = client.newWorkflowStub(SignaledWorkflow.class);
 *
 *    // Starts a workflow execution
 *    CompletableFuture<String> result = WorkflowClient.execute(workflow::workflow1, "input1");
 *
 *    // The sleep forwards the service clock for 65 minutes without blocking.
 *    // This ensures that the signal is sent after the one hour sleep in the workflow code.
 *    testEnvironment.sleep(Duration.ofMinutes(65));
 *    workflow.processSignal("signalInput");
 *
 *    // Blocks until workflow is complete. Workflow sleep forwards clock for one hour and
 *    // this call returns almost immediately.
 *    assertEquals("signalInput-input1", result.get());
 *
 *    // Closes workers and releases in-memory service.
 *    testEnvironment.close();
 *  }
